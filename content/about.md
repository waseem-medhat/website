### About me

> **I am Waseem Medhat -- a pharmacist, a (biostatistics) master's degree
> candidate, and a freelance biostatistician.**

My journey started a couple of months after graduation, and it has been ongoing
since then. I find myself really passionate about coding, and I am working on
that by learning and practicing a lot of programming inside and outside of the
statistics realm, including Shiny, basic web development technologies, Hugo
(which I used to make this site), and functional programming.

This site is my personal space in which I can produce, keep, and share content
about the topics that I love and work with everyday. I also try to make most of
the content as informational or helpful to others who share my interests or
curious about them.

### Why not post on social media?

Actually, I have been posting my content on social media for years, especially
on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waseem-medhat/). Here is why I think a
website/blog is better:

- Posts can be organized into categories and more easily accessed.

- Rich content with images, code snippets, blockquotes, etc.

- Good place to host projects flexibly.

- Social media algorithms can (and do) suppress some posts from appearing on
  other people's feeds.

- I **hate** social media.

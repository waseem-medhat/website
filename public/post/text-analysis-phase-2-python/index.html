    <p>I have been an R purist through my whole learning journey, but now I am picking
up Python. Although I did play with a lot of languages, including Python, my
goal was never to make something practical with them. But now, I felt it was
necessary to switch to Python for real to learn more natural language
processing. I don&rsquo;t believe R is lacking in power in that domain, but I know the
Python world is richer with educational resources.</p>
<p>In this post, I will share some of my thoughts on different parts of the
learning experience.</p>
<h1 id="first-resource-not-really">First resource (not really)</h1>
<p>Just as I started learning on R with a <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">book</a>,
I am did the same with Python with <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/">The NLTK book</a> by
Steven Bird. This book quickly caught my interest because: 1) it is written by
the developers of the library NLTK to teach how to use it, and 2) the content
assumes no prior programming experience and teaches Python, not just the
library.</p>
<p>I finished 2 chapters so far, and I can&rsquo;t help but compare the learning
experience of both resources.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Density:</strong> The R book had much less content per chapter and was more
hands-on. I believe this is kind of a common theme of the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; R books.
The NLTK book, on the other hand, was much more detailed. It was written in a
way to allow its use as a textbook for an academic curriculum with no
requirement of prior programming knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Programming:</strong> The tidy text book <em>and</em> package are about a
<a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html">&ldquo;tidy&rdquo;</a> format of text, which
is created with a simple <code>unnest_tokens()</code> call and allows analysis with the
popular Tidyverse tools. So, there isn&rsquo;t much new stuff to learn beyond
tidying text data. NLTK deals at a lower level with list- and dictionary-like
objects, which means that most of the processing algorithms are written with
stuff from the standard library. (More on that later.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter Notebooks</h1>
<p>I chose to code along the book and solve its exercises in Jupyter Notebooks. (I
have them hosted on <a href="https://github.com/waseem-medhat/nltk_book">GitHub</a>). They
seemed like a convenient place to learn as they are interactive and, more or
less, self-contained so I could print code results (including plots) in place.
So, they are more suitable for someone playing around with code. Plus, I wanted
to get started right away and didn&rsquo;t want to spend time setting up Vim.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t like Jupyter Notebooks very much. Yes, I do praise their
convenience, but I wouldn&rsquo;t use them in a real project except for the initial
exploratory work. There is also this little gripe I have about people publishing
notebooks on GitHub with absolutely no Markdown content or plots. How different
is it from a simple <code>.py</code> script now?</p>
<h1 id="data-structures-and-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
<p>It came as a (pleasant) surprise that I learned many things in Python that are
not specific to NLTK or text analysis. I had practice with a lot of the
fundamentals, dealing with dictionaries and lists, iteration, functional
programming, refactoring for efficiency, and a little <code>matplotlib</code>.</p>
<p>The part I captured below is a nice demonstration of what I learned in Python
coding. The first algorithm I wrote iterates over a list, <em>over another list</em>.
This yields a number of iterations equal to the product of the length of the two
lists. It took more than 30 minutes before I actually stopped it from running.
Then I rewrote it by making another algorithm that uses exactly one dictionary
and no nested iterations. It took about 500 milliseconds.</p>
<p><em>From half an hour to half a second!</em></p>
<p>Also, I wrote the dictionary-based algorithm in a functional form and a list
comprehension form. I love list comprehensions in Python: they make a really
elegant way to make a list with iteration.</p>
<p><img src="/post/text-analysis-phase-2-python_files/cmu.png" alt="algorithm"></p>
<h1 id="application">Application</h1>
<p>Exercises in the NLTK book included some relatively practical text analysis
questions. One of them was Zipf&rsquo;s law in which I created a plot similar to the
one <a href="/post/first-steps-with-text-analysis/">I previously made with R</a> but much
simpler and uglier. I need to up my game with <code>matplotlib</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/text-analysis-phase-2-python_files/zipf.png" alt="zipf"></p>
<p>Another one was to see the frequency of name initials in male and female names.</p>
<p><img src="/post/text-analysis-phase-2-python_files/initials.png" alt="initials"></p>
<hr>
<p>So far, I really enjoyed working with Python, both as a text analysis tool and a
programming language in general. It has a clean syntax and cool stuff like list
(and dict) comprehensions. But what I learned so far in terms of NLP is still
simple. I will keep studying from the NLTK book, and surely learn more Python in
process.</p>
